    paints the landscape she is most intimate with.  Along Long Island's north shore,  Ms. Branca fixes in 
      paint her experience of a sense of place.  Weaving a tapestry of color and light, Ms. Branca invites the viewer into the canvas to observe the rhythms and atmosphere of coastal scenes. The artist works both “en plein air” and in her Long Island studio, creating vibrant oil paintings that are a captivating expression of the beauty and mystery of nature in all seasons.
      <p class="MsoNormal">
      <span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Charter BT">"My paintings are my response to 
      the land," states Ms. Branca, "recollections of elemental things filtered through memory: some 
      angle of land meeting water altered only by the tides, the quality of 
      light as rock meets shore, the changing sky."</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">
